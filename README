This was an assignment I had to do for my Computer Comminication & Networks class. We had to learn the berkeley Sockets.
The server starts listening to a TCP port and waits until 2 clients connects.
Once that happens, it starts the game for those clients.

Installation:
    make

Run the Server:
    ./server PORT_NUMBER

Run the Client:
    ./client HOSTNAME PORT_NUMBER

Example:
On my machine, I run the `hostname` command to get the hostname. If the output is: "Killer_Machine", then I'll start the server on it, on port 6789
   ./server 6789
Then on another machine, or the same machine, I run a client
   ./client Killer_machine 6789
Then I would start a second client that will be player 2.
   ./client Killer_machine 6789

Once at least 2 players are connected, the server will start the game for them.
